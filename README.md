# This repo is closed

We will not be updating the code here for VCV 2.0 compatibility, nor do we expect to be updating the code in the repo in other ways.

The license permits many uses of this code, so as always people are free to re-use any pieces that are useful. The license also permits anyone to fork this repo and update it as they see fit.

The graphic images and panel designs have no special licensing either, so they may be re-used as allowed by the repo license.

Note that "Squinky Labs" is not a registered trademark, nor is the ugly logo that says "Squinky Labs" in a font called "Space Patrol". None the less, the name and logo have been used as our brand. While it is probably legal and permitted to re-use these, we would kindly ask that you not use them and develop your own name/trademark.
